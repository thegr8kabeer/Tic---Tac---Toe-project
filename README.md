# Tic---Tac---Toe-project
This is a python project that is made by thegr8kabeer and this is the easy method to create a tic tac toe project in python
This project uses simple and easy PEP8 guidelines to help the user understand the code.

Firstly, we are going to call ten (a huge amount ) functions that are:
1. def play_game() --------------- (this is the head function that contains the whole structure of this code and 
it's function is to play the game of tic tac toe) 

2. def display_board() --------------- ( this function is uded to display the board of the tic tac toe
